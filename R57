The way we can find the only repeating number in the list is to add every element in the list.
Then you want to do some multiplication. Take the length of the list, subtract it by 1 and then multiply it by the total length of the list.
Divide that number by two, then subtract from the total of every element in the list.
It should look like this:
(sum of the array) - (((length - 1) * length ) // 2)
This should return the only repeating integer in the list.
