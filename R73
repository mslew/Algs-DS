# In order to count the number of nodes in a linked list what I would do is create a temporary linked list.
# Copy the linked list into temp. Recuserisvely call the function by making a count of each time you remove a head.
# Then once the list is empty you exit the function. You should keep count of how many times this process is looped
# in order to determine the length.
